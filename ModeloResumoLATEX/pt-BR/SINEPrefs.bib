  Abstract                 = {Novel simple indirect control concepts for an active power filter (APF) application are proposed here. The concepts are exemplarily presented to control a modified APF structure. The main advantage over other control strategies is the achieved excellent simplicity-to-performance ratio. The proposed control strategies are based on the concept of virtual impedance emulation to provide high power factor in a system. To validate the operating principle, a single-phase low-power prototype has been built and experimentally tested. This prototype operates at a remarkably low switching frequency of 5 kHz and is digitally controlled by a digital signal processor.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel three-phase hybrid multilevel converter is proposed for medium-voltage applications. The converter employs a conventional three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) linking series connected half-bridge modules at each phase. With the proposed connection, a large portion of energy can be processed by the VSI by employing a single multi-pulse rectifier, while smaller power shares are processed within the half-bridge modules. Thus, the requirements for galvanically insulated dc sources are reduced. Modularity is naturally achieved. A modulation scheme for a four-level version is proposed and analyzed in detail. This scheme allows unidirectional power flow in all dc sources and, consequently, enables diode bridges to be employed in the rectification input stage for unidirectional applications.},

First, a passive integrated EMI filter is presented, which results in a volume reduction of 24\% compared to the discrete solution. However, this filter requires a planar ferrite core for the common-mode inductor. In order to eliminate the ferrite core and reduce the filter volume further (-40\% versus discrete filter), a passive integrated structure is combined with an active EMI filtering circuit. The transfer function, the volume, and the losses of the discrete and the two integrated filters, which are designed for a 600 W power-factor-corrected converter, are compared.},

Weight, volume, and efficiency of the concepts are compared for an input phase voltage range of 98-132 V and an input frequency range of 400-800 Hz. The 12-pulse system shows advantages concerning volume, efficiency, and complexity but is characterized by a high system weight. Accordingly, the three-level PWM rectifier is identified as the most advantageous solution. Finally, a novel extension of the 12-pulse rectifier system by turn-off power semiconductors is proposed which allows a control of the output voltage and, therefore, eliminates the dependency on the mains and load condition which constitutes a main drawback of the passive concept.},

The filter topology is chosen from different possibilities listed in a literature survey and studied regarding practical implementation issues, where requirements for an HF power amplifier to be applied in active filtering are derived. Special attention is put on the stability analysis where the challenges for the feedback are discussed, and a simple feedback structure is proposed. Other feedback concepts are analyzed, and limitations posed by stability requirements are presented. A prototype is designed and built, from which mathematical and experimental results are obtained demonstrating the potential and limitations of such a system.},

  Abstract                 = {Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) filters are typically included in offline power converters, controlling electromagnetic emissions, but adding volume to power electronic systems. During the last decades, one of the main objectives of the power electronics industry has been the increase of the power density. Thus, it is reasonable to analyze how filters affect power density values, imposing limits or ldquobarriersrdquo to it. The impact of the EMC filters on the overall volume of three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters is studied here for converters in the range of 5-10 kW. An analytical procedure based on the volume minimization of the EMC filters is proposed to estimate the total filter volume as function of the converters' rated power and switching frequency. With this, the minimum volume for EMC filters that allow the converters to comply with EMC standards regarding conducted emissions can be estimated and volume limitations identified. A discussion about the limits of power density for the considered three-phase PWM converters for state-of-the-art power semiconductors is performed, and optimum switching frequencies are identified. An experimental verification is carried out, which validates the achieved results.},

In this context, dc systems show potential for reducing losses and electronic equipment costs. Power electronics is the main enabler to this initiative and strong research efforts are ongoing in order to find solutions and evaluate the benefits and requirements for the power converters to be applied in dc systems. There is evidence that bipolar dc networks are advantageous due to higher reliability and increased power transmission capability. In such a network, currents are typically unbalanced and, thus, increase feeder losses. Another challenge in dc active distribution networks is the overall voltage stability due to the presence of distributed energy resources and loads with their power electronics interfaces. This study proposes a power converter and its control principles, which is able to balance the currents in a bipolar dc network and improve its stability. Its operation principles, control-oriented modeling, and laboratory implementation are presented and verified through experiments.},

Guidelines for a successful filter design are given, and components for a 5-kW rectifier prototype are selected. Furthermore, formulas for the estimation of the quasi-peak detector output based on the LISN output voltage spectrum are provided.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the study of a dc-dc buck converter with three-level buck clamping (buck-buck), zero-voltage switching (ZVS), active clamping, and constant-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM). Other ZVS dc-dc converter topologies that employ three-level switching cells are introduced, and their steady-state dc gain is analyzed. This analysis shows that the buck-buck converter has characteristics that warrant a more detailed study. A feature that is common to all the introduced topologies is the theoretical reduction of the voltage stresses across the active semiconductors to 50\% of the corresponding two-level converters. Accordingly, the switches of the buck-buck converter provide 50\% of the blocking voltage of a ZVS two-level buck converter. The steady-state analysis of the converter is performed according to the description of the operation stages of the converter. Based on the performed analyses, a comparative discussion to other topologies is given. Furthermore, a topologic derivation of the circuit is presented, which provides ZVS operation to all semiconductors. Finally, a simplified design procedure is proposed, and used to design and build a prototype. Experimental results from a laboratory prototype are presented.},

Five-level three-phase topologies are generated from only three insulated dc sources, while the number of semiconductors is the same as for the cascaded H bridge.

The operation of the PFC rectifier is described, including appropriate modulation and control strategies. Design guidelines for the magnetic components are derived for the MIPTs, boost inductors, and power semiconductor devices. Finally, a lab prototype is used to present experimental results. This prototype is rated at 7.5 kW and uses a modular structure to assemble a four legs per phase rectifier. Efficiency above 98\% from 40\% load and IEC61000-3-2 requirements are observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Decades of research have seen single-phase boost-type pulse-width modulation converters be employed as front-end power factor correction (PFC) rectifiers in commercial power supplies. The benefits of employing this technology to comply with power quality standards while assuring high efficiency, low volume, and weight have been observed. However, this paper shows that further efforts can be driven toward new topologies. In this context, novel single-phase rectifier circuits are introduced. These are able to double or triple the ripple frequency present at the input components. Furthermore, a high utilization of the switches is observed during both positive and negative grid half-cycles. The theoretical analysis of the proposed topologies as well as their operation in PFC applications are presented and different operation modes are proposed and a comparison with a state-of-the-art PFC rectifier is presented. Finally, experimental verification of a PFC rectifier doubling the switching frequency is presented in a 1-kW prototype employing a current self-control strategy.},
